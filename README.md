# StudentPerformancePredictionUsingMachineLearning

## Description:
This project aims to predict student academic performance levels — Low (L), Medium (M), or High (H) — using machine learning algorithms based on classroom behavior and participation data.
The dataset includes features such as:

Number of times the student raised hands

Use of class resources

Participation in discussions

Absence days

Background information (grade, gender, etc.)

## The project uses five machine learning models:

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Perceptron

Logistic Regression

Multi-Layer Perceptron (Neural Network)

The notebook is developed in Google Colab using Python, and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

The model evaluation is based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy.

## Technologies Used:
Python

Google Colab

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn
