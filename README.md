# StudentPerformancePredictionUsingMachineLearning
This project uses machine learning algorithms to classify student performance into Low (L), Medium (M), or High (H) based on behavioral and academic features such as raised hands, resource usage, discussions, and absences. Developed using Python, with five ML models including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Perceptron, and MLP.
